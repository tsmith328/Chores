ALL .cfg FILES SHOULD BE IN A DIRECTORY NAMED ./config/

Note: This was developed and the algorithms work best if there are six (6) areas for people to clean,
        and if there are six (6) users that will be assigned chores.
        
User information should be stored in users.cfg using JSON format:
        {User1_name : {"email" : user1_email, "trash_day" : user1_trashday}, ...}

Cleaning area information should be stored in areas.cfg using JSON format:
        {Area1_name : [task1_desription, task2_description, ...], ...}

Email account information should be stored in email.cfg using JSON format:
        {"smtp_server" : SMTP_server_name, "smtp_port" : SMTP_port, "username" : account_username, 
         "account_name" : email_account_name, "password" : account_password}
        
        Example: {"smtp_server" : "smtp.gmail.com", "smtp_port": 587, "username" : "fake_chores@gmail.com",
         "account_name" : "CHORES!!", "password" : "fakeP4ssword"}
